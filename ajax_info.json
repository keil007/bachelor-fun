<p>We are gonna talk about 5 different innovations in engaging customers.
Smart lead allocator is a way to connect single group of customers to one specfific person. That way it’s much easier to build a connection and understanding between two worlds. Customers are sort out by an algorithm, which determines who is the best person to talk to our clients.
Another innovating way to engage customers is to make personalised videos for tchem. People love being treated personally especially in the way, they are not expecting it to. This mechanism may take more time than calls or messages, but data proves that it is more efficient than other technics.
Call wait time diffuser. Is here anybody that likes waiting for your call to answear? It definitely isn’t me. But as a company we can solve this problem, by letting people know how much they would probably wait for somebody to respond. This way customers gonna be ready to wait time out, or come back when there would be less traffic.
 On the other hand, call tracker is a simple tool, that helps us understand which keywords or campaigns are more useful than other ones. It’s a software designed to boost our sales and customer engagement.
And last but not least of course is a proactive chat. Web chat is a great way to keep in touch with customers. Quick messages system is pretty popular, but can be slightly improved. We want our clients to have positive feelings as they enter our website or interact with us. So to make their experience more enjoyable we can make pop-up windows less intrusive and analize their needs with ready tools and so on and so on. There is plenty of methods to make it better, but let’s keep going with next slide.
